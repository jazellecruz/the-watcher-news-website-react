# The Watcher

## *Powered by* [<\/newscatcher\>](https://newscatcherapi.com)

The Watcher delivers the latest global headlines reported by trusted and reliable news sources. 
This project is made with React.js along with Material UI for a responsive UI, and Axios for calling Newscatcher's API.

## Future Implementations

Create a Node.js backend server where API requests are made instead of calling the api in the client's side for a more secure communication.
